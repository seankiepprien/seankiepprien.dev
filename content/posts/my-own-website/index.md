### A Dev website? How original! /s
\
Practically every devs has their own website. Some are blogs, others are just portfolios. A personnal website is a good way to archive what you've done or to share your thoughts to the world.  
\
Since i started coding last year, i learned a lot.
I've gone from making ugly, plain HTML sites and in the span of a couple months i was making SPA's using Vuejs. Needless to say, the world of web development is massive. The 2021 front-end roadmap has over a hundred different things on it and every months, i feel like more gets added to this seemingly endless list.  
\
With that in mind, i think that making a blog that will serve as an archive for anything learned or just a place to stash my thoughts seem like a good way to keep learning and help myself memorize what i've learned.  
\
I made this website using Nuxtjs which is a framework based on Vuejs. The main advantage of using Nuxt over Vuejs is how quick Nuxt can get your website up and running. I wont be describing Nuxt in details just yet. That will be for another post.  
\
Along with Nuxt, this website is using Nuxt Content which is a module for Nuxtjs. Nuxt Content let you
manage your content through an API that will fetch any files writen in Markdown, YAML, JSON, XML or CSV. This makes your website easily maintainable because of how easy and quick it is to add content on your platform.
